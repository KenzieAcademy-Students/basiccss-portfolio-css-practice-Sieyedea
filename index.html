     <p>The son of the god of Sun and Moon, this diety was turned into a woman when he fell to earth. The rumor was that Jayden was "struck by a falling star" while observing the creatures on the planet. The diety has since been stuck on the blue and green planet, looking for ways to get back to his home in the cosmos. No one knows exactly why the diety took on the opposite gender, but one historian believes it was to hide the diety's mortal body. They believed that Sagittarius A, The Destructive God, sent out its minions in search for vulnerable sentient beings to devour and become bigger. They say that Sagittarius gets the bulk of its power from devouring these beings. The wareabouts of Jayden on earth is currently unknown.</p>

     <p><i>I am very excited on learning everything you may need to know on how to make your own site. I would love to make something that has to deal with writing and roleplaying while still making it very engaging. Another reason why I am excited is because my mind gets to engage in activity where as, usually at work it is usually my body more active. My grandmother was more software, my mother hardware, I am in the middle of learning computers.</i>
